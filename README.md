The Supermarket Management System is a software application designed to help streamline the daily operations of a supermarket. The system provides a user-friendly interface for cashiers, managers, and customers to manage their respective tasks.

The system includes the following key features:

1. Cashier Login: The cashier login allows authorized personnel to log in to the system and perform transactions such as scanning items, adding discounts, and calculating the total cost of goods purchased.

2. Manager Login: The manager login provides access to advanced features such as inventory management, employee management, and sales analytics. Managers can monitor sales trends, track employee performance, and generate reports to help make informed business decisions.

3. Customer Registration: The customer registration feature allows new customers to create an account with the supermarket. Customers can use their account to view purchase history, receive special offers, and manage their personal information.

4. Inventory Management: The inventory management feature allows managers to track inventory levels, order new stock, and set alerts for low stock levels. This helps to ensure that the supermarket has enough stock to meet customer demand.
